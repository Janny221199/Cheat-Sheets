# Cloud
- Usage of (multiple) remote IT-Rescources over the internet
- key advantages: flexible, scalable, availability, performance, global, reliable. secure
- hardware managed and hosted by cloud provider like AWS, Azure and GCP

There is a fundamental distinction between public, private and hybrid clouds. 

## Public clouds
Public clouds are hosted on servers of external cloud providers. Here, the cloud can be set up and used quickly according to requirements.

## Private cloud (On-Premise)
A private cloud is company-specific hardware that is operated by the company itself.
In this case, good transparency regarding data protection and IT security can be guaranteed.
 
## Hybrid cloud
The hybrid cloud is a combination of the public and private cloud, which hosts selected software on a company-internal infrastructure and other software at public cloud providers.

## Cross cloud
The usage of multiple / different cloud providers.


## Different Service models as abstraction layer for customers
In typical On-Site / On-premises environments the company has to buy, manage, host and configure compute resources, networks and so on.
It requires a lot of experts. In addition, the company couldnt just buy or sell any amount of hardware regarding the current usage. Furthermore, 
the hardware must be changed and renewed after time.

### SaaS Software as a Service
SaaS is commonly a browser or (mobile / desktop) app, which could be used by an (end) user. Mostly, the user must pay monthly for the service.
The user doesnt have to worry about the technical settings, updates and server administration.

### PaaS Software as a Service
With platform as a service the user gets / sells a fully managed and set up environment mostly for software developer. The user could deploy and run his own developed software and storage.

### IaaS Infrastructure as a Service
IaaS offers (typically virtualized) compute, storage, and networking resources on demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis. The customer doesnt have to take care about the
server hardware. He could just *rent* computing resources and build his own system and environment.
