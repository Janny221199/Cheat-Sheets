# Network Topologies
- network designs


## Star Topology
- central networking device such as a [Switch](Network-Devices/Switch.md) or a [Hub](Network-Devices/Hub.md) which handles all traffic


Advantages | Disadvantages
--- | ---
scalable | more expensive
central device often robust | single point of failure

## Bus Topology
- one single cable (backbone)
- not only one direction
- all data destined for each device travels along the same cable in both directions

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
|easier and most cost-efficient to set up  | single point of failure |
| | difficult to troubleshoot |
| | can't handle a large amount of data |


## Ring Topology
- devices (e.g. computers) are connected to each other with a cable (in a circle)
- only one direction
- sends data across the loop until it reached the destination

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
|easier to troubleshoot  | not efficient |
| | single point of failure |
