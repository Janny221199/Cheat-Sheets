# OSI-Model
- **O**pen **S**ystems **I**nterconnection
- 1980s
- The complexity of networks must be reduced and delegated (similar to the [Divide and Conquer](../../Algorithms/Divide-and-Conquer.md)) Algorithm
- standardized reference model

## Layers
- 7 layers
	- Layers are arranged vertically on top of each other regarding to the hardware proximity
	- Each layer provides services to the next higher layer via an interface
	- Each layer uses services of the next lower one
