# MAC Address
- **M**edia **A**ccess **Control** Address
- devices on a network have a physical [network interface card](../Hardware/Network-Interface-Card.md) on the device's main board
- assigned an unique address
- 12 character [hexadecimal](../Computer-Science-Basics/Number-Systems.md#Base%2016%20Hexadecimal) number divided into six parts by a colon
	- first half: vendor / factory who build the network interface
	- second half: unique address of the network interface
- can be spoofed (network device pretends to identify as another device using a different MAC Address)
