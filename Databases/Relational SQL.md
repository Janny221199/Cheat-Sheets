- stores information in tables
- often the tables have shared information between them

# Tables
tables will often contain a column that has a unique ID (primary key) which will then be used in other tables to reference it and cause a relationship between the tables
## Columns
- Each column, better referred to as a field has a unique name per table
- type of data (integer, string. date, geospatial etc..)
- column containing an integer can also have an auto-increment feature enabled -> gives each row of data a unique number that grows (increments) with each subsequent row

## Rows
- Rows or records are what contains the individual lines of data
