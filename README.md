# IT-Cheat-Sheets
## What is that about?
In the beginning of 2022 I realized, that I have no good structure for my *knowledge base*. Over the time I used different kinds of tools with also different types of file extensions. For example, I used software like Excel, Word, OneNote, PowerPoint, simple PDF-Readers, Notion, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Notability, Apple Notes, simple pictures, simple text files and LaTeX files.  
I also structured my files in a not optimized structure for a good knowledge base. My study notes were ordered by semesters and single modules. It was good for learning for a specific exam, but nowadays, I realize, that a lot of topics are connected within different modules and it is really hard to keep a good overview of some topics. I also hadn't short notes for each important topics. I often just marked up some (for me) important lines in a big script.  
Apart from my studies, I rarely took notes for my self. "I will remember that" or "I will know where to find it again in the future" aren't really working out in the future.  
Because I am learning a lot of new things atm and I realized, that I don't really find information I need for my current projects in my previous notes, I decided to start taking this notes again. In this way, I would also like to share my notes with you.

## About me
Maybe I should introduce myself briefly :D  
My name is Janny (nickname of Jan-Eric) and I am currently 22 years old.
In the fall of 2021, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Business Information / Software Engineering in Germany.  
In my freetime I love to code, improve my skills in modern technologies and do some stuff in IT-Security.  
Apart from this stuff I love to work out :D  
But most of the time I work for my job and lately for my own little Startup.
In the future, I wanna work on interest projects and travel a lot. I am also thinking about a Master's degree.

## My IT interests and what you can expect
As you might have guessed, I'm going to focus primarily on **technical topics** in these cheat sheets. I will not cover topics like fitness, sports, business, investments, etc.  
As the name implies, these are cheat sheets, and I try to keep the topics short and to the point. It should serve for me and hopefully also for you as a **reference book**.  
More detailed information, explanations and backgrounds I will possibly publish in blogs at a later time. But this is just a thought.
This cheat sheets will cover topics all about:
- [Computer Science](Computer-Science-Basics/Computer-Science.md)
- [Software Engineering](Software-Engineering/Software-Engineering.md)
- [Data Structures](Data-Structures/Data-Structures.md)
- [Algorithms](Algorithms/Algorithms.md)
- [Networks](Networks/Networks.md)
- [IT-Security](IT-Security/IT-Security.md)
- [Operating-Systems](Operating-Systems/Operating-Systems.md)
- [Server-Administration](Server-Administration/Server-Administration.md)
- [DevOps](DevOps/DevOps.md)
- [Cloud](Cloud/Cloud.md)

## Collaboration
My core motivation for these cheat sheets was a nice and good knowledge base for myself where I can quickly look things up.  
But I think I can share my knowledge with you while I'm at it. Of course, I would be happy if you also bring in ideas and also correct me. We all have different knowledge in different areas and should learn from each other. 
Especially on GitHub, changes from others can flow in particularly well. Therefore, feel free and create a pull request if necessary.  
Feel free to point out errors in content as well as spelling mistakes. I am not a native English speaker.

## Why Obsidian and GitHub?
As I mentioned before, I used a lot of different tools and faced a lot of issues with different file types.  
Now I wanna keep it more simple. I just wanna have a type of files I could access, share and store everywhere.  
Markdown files are perfectly for that. It's just plain text with some additional markup features where I can also include images and so on.
I also can easily keep track of the files with a version control system like Git.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a cool software to create and work with markdown languages. The software provides nice features for visualizing connection between different notes and so on. There are a lot of different features you can use and install with both *core* and *external* plugins. 
But on this project, I am just focussing on the core features of simple markdown languages. Because in this way I can open, edit and share this files everywhere. Not just in Obsidian.  
This is the reason, why I **don't** use the Obsidian `[[Wikilinks]]` atm, because they are not supported everywhere yet. Instead of *Wikilinks* I will use the well known markdown links: `[label](destination)`. 
So I would be very happy if you (at least as long as wikilinks et cetera are not established everywhere) would stick to the [markdown style guides and best practices](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) when making changes.  
For this reason, I decided to keep the `.obsidian` configuration folder inside this repository.  
So you can work with the same obsidian settings locally - if you use obsidian at all.  
To keep a consistent structure, I decided to include images, PDFs and so on in a subfolder named *attachments* with a relative link to the file.
