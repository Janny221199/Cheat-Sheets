- New Technology File System NFTS in modern versions of windows
- before there was FAT16/FAT32 (File Allocation Table) and HPFS (High Performance File System)
- FAT partitions still in use today ( USB Drives, MicroSD cards etc.)
- NTFS is known as a journaling file system. In case of a failure, the file system can automatically repair the folders/files on disk using information stored in a log file. This function is not possible with FAT.
- NTFS addresses many of the limitations of the previous file systems:
	-  Supports files larger than 4GB
	-   Set specific permissions on folders and files
	-   Folder and file compression
	-   Encryption (Encryption File System or EFS)
- typically windows is running on the file system `C:\`
- on NFTS volumes you can set the following permissions that grant or deny access to files and foldes:
	-   Full control
	-   Modify
	-   Read & Execute
	-   List folder contents
	-   Read
	-   Write
