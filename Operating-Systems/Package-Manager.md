# Package-Manager

A package manager is a tool which provides a collection of software tools and automates the process of installing, upgrading and removing software programs.

Different Linux distributions and other operating systems basically follow a different concept and use different package managers by default.

The best-known package managers are probably "APT" (Advanced Package Tool) under debian / ubunthu-based operating systems and "Pacman" under Arch-based distributions.
