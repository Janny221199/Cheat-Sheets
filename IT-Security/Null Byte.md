- null bytes is an injection technique where URL-encoded representation such as `%00` or `0x00` in hex with user-supplied data to terminate strings
- trick the web app into disregarding whatever comes after the Null Byte
- this could be used when an app appends an string or file extension to an input value, which we wanna skip
- **the null byte trick is fixed and not working with `PHP 5.3.4` and above**
