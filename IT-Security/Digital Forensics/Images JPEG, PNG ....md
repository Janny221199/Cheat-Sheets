#  Photo EXIF Data MetaData
EXIF stands for Exchangeable Image File Format; it is a standard for saving metadata to image files. Whenever you take a photo with your smartphone or with your digital camera, plenty of information gets embedded in the image. The following are examples of metadata that can be found in the original digital images:

-  Camera model / Smartphone model
-  Date and time of image capture
-  Photo settings such as focal length, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings
- GPS data

Tool `exiftool` reads and writes metadata to an image (`exiftool IMAGE`), installed via `sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl`
