3 main Goals of IT-Security:

# Confidentiality
You want to ensure that secret and private files and information are only available to intended persons

# Integrity
involves maintaining the consistency, accuracy and trustworthiness of data over its entire lifecycle. Data must not be changed in transit, and steps must be taken to ensure data cannot be altered by unauthorized people

# Availability
should be consistently and readily accessible
