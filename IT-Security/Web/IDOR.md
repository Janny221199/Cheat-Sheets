- Insecure Direct Object Reference
- type of access control vulnerability
- arises when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly with too much trust in the input data without validating if the requested data belongs to the user data
- used in post data, query strings, cookies and so on
- data could be encoded / hashed (so must be decoded, changed and encoded again to request other objects)
- best way to check it with 2 accounts
- have a look at the Web Browser Developer Network Tab, find possible Request, edit values and request again
